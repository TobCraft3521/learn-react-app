This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Just learning some react basics
If you want to try it out yourself use...
```bash
npm install
```
(or just npm i)
```bash
npx json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8000 
```
... to install the local servers.
